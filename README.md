# Therapy for Change

If you are here, you are probably looking for change in your life. Whatever the reasonfor your search, I can help you to get back on track. I'm an experienced therapist and have helped men and women with difficulties ranging from feeling stuck in their lives to overcoming anxiety, depression, trauma, phobias and longstanding relationship difficulties. 

I see therapy as a means of personal development and challenging times as a springboard for positive growth. Why not meet me for a friendly chat about how I may be able to help you.
